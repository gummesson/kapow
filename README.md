# Kapow!

A punchy [PowerShell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell) framework, similar to [Oh my Zsh!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [Bash it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it).

## But why?

The PowerShell needs some love. Seriously.

## Features

- Short hand aliases
- Useful scripts
- Tab completion *(requires PowerShell 3.0)*
- Colorful themes
- Simple documentation

## Prerequisites

Some of the plugins remove default aliases for certain PowerShell tasks, like `gl` for `Get-Location` in the `git` plugin. If you're a normal user of the PowerShell it'll probably won't affect you, but be aware of it.

## Installation

### Set up the PowerShell

First you need to make sure that you can actually execute scripts by running `Get-ExecutionPolicy` in the PowerShell. If the output doesn't say `RemoteSigned` or `Unrestricted` you need to run the PowerShell as an *Administrator* and execute the following command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Confirm`. This will grant the current user the permission to run scripts.

### Install Kapow!

If you haven't got a `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file in your `C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell` folder you can run the `Ã¬nstall.ps1` script by executing the following command: `.\install.ps1`. This will copy the `example.profile.ps1` file to the `WindowsPowerShell` folder and rename it to `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.

If you have a `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file in your `C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell` folder you need to copy the content of the `example.profile.ps1` and paste it into the your `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file.

### Set the Kapow! path

The next step is to set the `$KapowDefaultPath` variable to point to the right folder in the `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file. The default path is `C:\Git\kapow`. This is incredibly important since everything will be sourced from that particular folder.

### Set which plugins to use

The last thing you need to do is to choose which plugins to use. Look around in the `plugins` and then add them to the `$KapowUserPlugins` array in the `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file and you're done!

### Optional: install Console2

The look of the PowerShell itself leaves a lot to be desired. If you want a more fine tuned experience I highly recommend that you install [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/).
