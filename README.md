# Kapow!

A punchy [PowerShell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell) framework, similar to [Oh my Zsh!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [Bash it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it).

## But why?

The PowerShell needs some love. Seriously.

## Features

- Short hand aliases
- Useful scripts
- Tab completion *(requires PowerShell 3.0)*
- Colorful themes

## Prerequisites

Kapow! requires atleast PowerShell 2.0 in order to run. You can find out which version you're using by running `$PSVersionTable.PsVersion`.

## Installation

### Set up the PowerShell

First you need to make sure that you can actually execute scripts by running `Get-ExecutionPolicy` in the PowerShell. If the output doesn't say `RemoteSigned` or `Unrestricted` you need to run the PowerShell as an *Administrator* and execute the following command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. This will grant the current user the permission to run scripts.

### Install Kapow!

Run the `Ã¬nstall.ps1` script by executing the following command: `.\install.ps1`. This will copy and create the `Kapow.psm1` file to the `WindowsPowerShell\Modules` folder. You can then import the module by adding `Import-Module Kapow` to either your `Windows.PowerShell_profile.ps1` or `profile.ps1` file.

### Set your default settings

The next step is to set the `$KapowDefaultPath` variable to point to the right folder in the `Kapow.psm1` file. The default path is `C:\Git\kapow`. This is incredibly important since everything will be sourced from that particular folder!

Change the `$KapowDefaultHome` if you're planning on using a theme that's replacing your "home" folder with a tilde (`~`) and set the default prompt theme by changing the `$KapowDefaultTheme` variable.

The `$KapowDefaultEditor` variable is primarily used for the `edit` plugin, so if you're not planning to use it leave it blank. The same thing is true for the `$KapowEnableGitColors`. Set it to `$false` if you're not going to use the `git` plugin.

The last thing you need to do is to choose which plugins to use. Look around in the `plugins` and then add them to the `$KapowDefaultPlugins` array in the `Kapow.psm1` file and you're done!

### Optional: install a better console

The look of the PowerShell itself leaves a lot to be desired. If you want a more fine tuned experience I highly recommend that you install [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/), or better yet, [ConsoleZ](https://github.com/cbucher/console).
